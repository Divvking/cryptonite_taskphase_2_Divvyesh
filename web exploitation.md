# SOAP
## Problem
The web project was rushed and no security assessment was done. Can you read the /etc/passwd file?
Additional details will be available after launching your challenge instance.
## Thought Process
- Website has some interactive buttons, clicking them sends a request, so I opened the Network Tab to inspect it closely
```html
<form class="detailForm" action="/data" method="POST">
                        <input required="" type="hidden" name="ID" value="1">
                  <button type="submit" class="btn btn-sm
                      btn-outline-secondary">Details</button>
                    </form>
```
- The payload tab seems to imply the existence of some form of xml, which could be exploited by using an XXE (XML External Entity) Injection
- Since we need to use an XXE and modify the payload, I did some research about basic XXE Injections
- To obtain the flag at /etc/passwd, I found this XXE Injection:
```xml
<!DOCTYPE foo [ <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd"> ]>
```
- For some strange reason, any other xxe injection I try on burp suite works but the moment I try the one which should give me `/etc/passwd`, it doesn't work
- I attempted cURLing but it still gives no response, so I am going to have to leave this level on hold for the time being
- Tried again after 2 days, worked this time. Used BurpSuite to intercept and modify the request.

# Forbidden Paths
## Problem
We know that the website files live in /usr/share/nginx/html/ and the flag is at /flag.txt but the website is filtering absolute file paths. Can you get past the filter to read the flag?
## Thought Process
- Provided with a website called Web eReader, which has a form accepting file names.

- Tried `flag.txt`, wouldn't be that simple if it was a ctf problem.
- since it says that the absolute path is forbidden, we use the relative path. Therefore, it would be `../../../../../flag.txt`
- flag: `picoCTF{7h3_p47h_70_5ucc355_6db46514}`
# Cookies
## Problem
Who doesn't love cookies? Try to figure out the best one. http://mercury.picoctf.net:29649/
## Thought Process
- Well this should be a walk in the park, the level being marked as easy, and having done a similar question in OasisCTF 2024.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7265b468-71fb-4d8c-b322-c589ebd2d21a)
- Go to the cookies tab, set the value to some 0 or positive value, and reload the page
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/44594854-3f0a-4ac7-a06f-0ecdf6e24b71)
- On trying a different value, it returns a different message, e.g. I love chocolate chip cookies. So, I think if we keep trying, we might be able to land on the flag.
- We can try a binary search within the first 100 values, but there is no idea of how many cookie values are acceptable.
- So I tried using BurpSuite's intruder feature, which I was trying out on the previous level while trying to comprehend how the software works.
- It basically simplifies the bruteforce as I just have to specify the payload type and range, followed by a grep specification for extraction the flag. It completely removes the need of a script from the process.
- After adding the specification to extract results containing the flag format, I ran the intruder.

- Set cookie name as payload position hit start attack
- Well, by the look of it, I might have done it on the wrong request, as a result of which, it always returned name=snickerdoodle
- Retrying with the correct request this time,
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/411eb00d-e628-4e5e-bf89-f98365e81b7d)
- Well, the payload with a 1 under the `picoCTF{` list is the payload which returns the flag.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f11f207d-292d-4ee4-ae21-e5f9a9b68281)
- flag: `picoCTF{3v3ry1_l0v3s_c00k135_a1f5bdb7}`
