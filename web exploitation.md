# SOAP
## Problem
The web project was rushed and no security assessment was done. Can you read the /etc/passwd file?
Additional details will be available after launching your challenge instance.
## Thought Process
- Website has some interactive buttons, clicking them sends a request, so I opened the Network Tab to inspect it closely
```html
<form class="detailForm" action="/data" method="POST">
                        <input required="" type="hidden" name="ID" value="1">
                  <button type="submit" class="btn btn-sm
                      btn-outline-secondary">Details</button>
                    </form>
```
- The payload tab seems to imply the existence of some form of xml, which could be exploited by using an XXE (XML External Entity) Injection
- Since we need to use an XXE and modify the payload, I did some research about basic XXE Injections
- To obtain the flag at /etc/passwd, I found this XXE Injection:
```xml
<!DOCTYPE foo [ <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd"> ]>
```
- For some strange reason, any other xxe injection I try on burp suite works but the moment I try the one which should give me `/etc/passwd`, it doesn't work
- I attempted cURLing but it still gives no response, so I am going to have to leave this level on hold for the time being
ðŸš§**LEVEL ATTEMPT HAS TEMPORARILY STOPPED HERE DUE TO SOME ISSUES WITH THE XXE PAYLOAD NOT RETURNING ANY RESPONSE**ðŸš§
